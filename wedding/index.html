            <p>
                Our official wedding in England will be family only so we want
                to have a
                big summer holiday to celebrate with our friends before we tie
                the
                knot.
                We would love it if you would join us for <b>a week in Corfu,
                    Greece</b>
                from Sunday 28 June until Sunday 5 July 2020!


            </p>
            <p>
                Think of it as a combined holiday/stag/hen/blessing thing.
            </p>
            <p>
                What will we do? Chill, Explore, Swim, Drink, Eat. We’ll have a
                stag/hen night during the week!</p><p>Friday we’ll gather for a
                blessing from Botond Butuza, followed by a special dinner by the
                sea
                (covered by us).

                at <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/aJWPgAy1vU7eZfnY7">Kastelli House</a>, where we will spend most of our time, but we
                have
                found a couple of villas just down the road which look ideal for
                sleeping.

                Accommodation and booze for the week will come to under £300 per
                person.
                We can work out food and cars, nearer the time, but we will
                keep things as economical as possible. Eat together, share
                transport etc.
