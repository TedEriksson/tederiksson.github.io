        <h1>Save the Date:<br>Ted & Sophie's<br>Pre-Wedding Jamboree</h1>
        <h2>28 June – 05 July 2020</h2>
        <img src="IMG_1071.jpg" alt="" class="left"/>
        <p>
            Our main wedding in England will be family only so we want to have a
            big summer holiday to celebrate with our friends before we tie the
            knot.
            We would love it if you would join us for <b>a week in Corfu, Greece</b>
            from Sunday 28 June until Sunday 5 July 2020!
            
            
        </p>
        <p>
            Think of it as a combined holiday/stag/hen/blessing thing.
        </p>
        <p>
            What will we do? Chill, Explore, Swim, Drink, Eat. We’ll have a
            stag/hen night during the week and on Friday we’ll gather for a
            blessing from Botond Butuza, followed by a special dinner by the sea
            (covered by us).

            <a href="https://www.google.com/flights#flt=/m/04jpl.CFU.2020-06-28*CFU./m/04jpl.2020-07-05;c:GBP;e:1;sd:1;t:f" target="_blank">Flights can be found here.</a> Space is limited
            at Kastelli House, where we will spend most of our time, but we have
            found a couple of villas just down the road which look ideal for
            sleeping.
        </p>
        <p>
            Costs should be approx £250 per person for villas and booze for the
            week! We can work out food and cars, nearer the time, but we will
            keep things as economical as possible. Eat together, share transport
            etc. For now, so we can get everything booked in while the price is
            low, depending on numbers, the up front cost should be somewhere
            between £150 - £200.
        </p>
        <p>
            <a href="https://forms.gle/HjGgouCjCWSYzrXW7" target="_blank">Fill out this RSVP by 14th September.</a> Once we have numbers,
            we’ll take deposits and book the accommodation.
        </p>

            It would mean the world to us if you could come.<br>Lots of Love,<br>
